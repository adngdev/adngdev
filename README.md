# :smirk_cat: Nice To See You

 Hi! I'm Jamie, a full stack developer from Vietnam :vietnam: and currently living in Melbourne :australia:.

Passionate about problem-solving and continuous growth. From coding challenges to real-world dilemmas, I'm always eager to dive in and find solutions.

My favorite quote: _"Slow Motion is Better than No Motion"_
